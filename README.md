# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Realtime Speech Web SDK

# About

This repository contains the source code for the Web SDK to connect to the realtime speech service. There's also an example client for reference. This is meant for clients in a browser environment. For NodeJS clients, please refer to the Realtime Speech TypeScript SDK.

## Installation instructions

Do the following to install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @oracle/oci-ai-speech-realtime-web
```

You can also choose to clone this git repo and install from source.

## Documentation

The home page for the OCI Speech Service can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/speech/).
The API reference for OCI Speech Service can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/speech/latest/).

Note that realtime speech URLs are distinct from the speech URLs mentioned in the above link. To obtain a realtime speech url, take a speech url, and replace 'speech' with realtime. Also replace https with wss. 

For example, for the following speech url:

```https://speech.aiservice.af-johannesburg-1.oci.oraclecloud.com```

This is the corresponding realtime speech URL:

```wss://realtime.aiservice.af-johannesburg-1.oci.oraclecloud.com```

## Examples
We have an example here itself, it can be found in the [example-client](example-client/) directory.


## Development
Follow the instructions in the [Development Readme](ai-speech-realtime-sdk-web/README.md) to get started with local development/testing of the SDK code.
